Eventually, we started the whole thing from the beggining because it was messed up.
This actually helped because we were able to understand how javascript works with html.
Achieved a few things today.
So far we created the /list, /start, /question, /answer.
There are a few mistakes if the status is not okay, meaning with the error messages, but if the status is ok it works fine.

Corrected the error messages if the status is not okay. 
Today we had a meeting to discuss our parts in the assignment. We discussed that we should be more active in social media, this part is Sotiris'. In addition, we discussed how Zacharias is going to do the design on CSS. Eventually, Myriam has to work on the rest of the javascript code, which is /score, /location, /leaderboard.

<br/>
Date 5 December</br>
Myriam, Zacharias, Sotiris</br>
Our deadline is tomorrow. So far the team had already prepared the design and we already created the /score, /location, /leaderboard. We are having some troubles about getting the treasure0hint-id and the session but we will consulted our instructor Mr. Nicos Kasenidis and it's working now. We also created a 'Play Again' button in our leaderboard page, which was reccommended by our proffessor. We also alert the user if skip is pressed. Achieved a few details on the assignment today. For now, we have to make the inputs change depending on the type of question, and Zaxarias has to work on the testing part.

Today is the last day. The only thing that is left is the question/answer part. Meaning we have to make the inputs change depending on the type of question, and the testing part. Myriam already started her part but there are some difficulties.
