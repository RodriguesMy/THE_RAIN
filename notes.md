Had a quick meeting with our Mr. Nearchos Paspallis.
Started the whole thing from the beggining because it was messed up.
This actually helped because we were able to understand how javascript works with html.
Achieved a few things today.
So far we created the /list, /start, /question, /answer.
There are a few mistakes if the status is not okay, meaning with the error messages, but if the status is ok it works fine.
I will contact my proffeson in Monday to sort that out.
